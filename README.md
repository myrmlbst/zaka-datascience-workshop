# Introduction to Data Science workshop
## Medical Cost Prediction Model

This repository contains the source code for a project built during a 1 hour hands-on data science workshop hosted by Zaka AI on March 1, 2025.
The project is an implementation of an AI model, linear regression, to predict costs of medical treatment for individuals based on their age, sex, BMI and other personal information that could pertain to their health.
